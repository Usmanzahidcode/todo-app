# Todo Application in Java
This is a simple Todo application that Iâ€™m building as part of my journey into Java. 
My goal is to explore the language, its ecosystem, and best practices while implementing 
a small but functional project.

The application allows users to create, list, mark, and clear todos through a command-line 
interface. While Java isn't my primary language, I enjoy diving into different technologies 
to expand my understanding of software development.

Any feedback or suggestions for improvement are always welcome!
